##Introduction
Early ocular illness identification is a cost-efficient and reliable technique to stop blindness brought on by conditions including diabetes, glaucoma, cataracts, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and many others. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are currently at least 2.2 billion vision impairments worldwide, of which at least 1 billion might have been avoided. In order to lessen the strain of the ophthalmologist and save patients' vision from being damaged, rapid and automatic illness diagnosis is essential and urgent. Following the provision of high-quality medical eye fundus photos, computer vision and deep learning may automatically identify ocular disorders.
